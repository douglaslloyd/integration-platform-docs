# Job Notifications

Integration Manager has the capability of sending email notifications for certain job completion events (not currently available for DataCloud SaaS accounts).

This feature requires access to an external SMTP server in order to deliver the email notifications. SMTP is currently the only supported protocol for job notifications.

## Configuring Notification Properties

To configure Integration Manager notification properties:

1. Enable Integration Manager to connect to your SMTP server and format the notifications by adding the following entries to your application.properties file:

    ```
    # SMTP Connection Info
    spring.mail.host= [hostname of the smtp server]
    spring.mail.username= [username to access smtp server (with send email permissions)]
    spring.mail.password= [password to access smtp server]
    ```

    ```
    # Job Notifications Config
    notifications.enabled=true
    notifications.mailFrom=noreply@yourcompanydomain.com
    notifications.mailTo=admin@yourcompanydomain.com,finance@yourcompanydomain.com    notifications.attachLogs=true
    ```
    
2. Restart the Integration Manager service.
