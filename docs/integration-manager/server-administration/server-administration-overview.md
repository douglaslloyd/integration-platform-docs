This topic needs to introduce the topics covered in this section.

For example, the Quick Start Installation topic links here with "The application.properties file can be used for a variety of configurations to tailor Integration Manager to your requirements and environment.

Integration Manager can be deployed and configured to meet the most demanding production requirements.
