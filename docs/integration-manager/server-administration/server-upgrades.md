# Server Upgrades

## Overview

Integration Manager server upgrades are safe and reversible for 3.x.a -> 3.x.b upgrades. It is highly recommended to test upgrades first on a development server to identify any post-upgrade issues (i.e., test your deployed integrations) in order to prevent a rollback scenario.

Upgrade installations will typically require that your first uninstall Integration Manager, but note that uninstalling will remove ONLY application libraries, it will NOT remove any of your application data or configuration metadata.

## Upgrade Instructions

The upgrade process is no different than performing a new installation. See [Quick Start Installation](../quickstart-install).
