# Running Configurations

Configurations can be run manually or on a schedule. An integration is executed when you run an associated configuration. When completed, runtime metrics will be available for review. 

:::note

To run a configuration, it must be in the Active state. See [Activating or Inactivating Configurations](./activating-or-inactivating-configurations).

## Running a Configuration Manually

1. Select the **Configurations** tab.
2. Do one of the following:
   - Click the **Run** button that is displayed for that configuration:

       ![Configuration Run 1](/img/Configuration-Run1.png)

   - Click the configuration name to go to the Configuration Details page, review the displayed information and make changes if required, then click the **Run Configuration** button:

       ![Configuration Run 2](/img/Configuration-Run2.png)

3. The associated integration is executed and you are navigated to the **Jobs** page, where you can track the execution status of your Configuration Job. See [Viewing Job Run History](../jobs/viewing-job-run-history).
