# Creating Configurations

A configuration is a set of properties and parameters that specify when, where, and how an integration will be executed. Configurations contain references to a specific integration, the location in which the integration will be executed, and the frequency at which executions will occur.

You can create configurations using any of the following methods.


## Importing a Configuration

**<font color="red">Why is it that when you create your first configuration, you are taken to the Import Configuration page and you upload a config file, but thereafter you only need to name the configuration and have to upload the package from the Setup page</font>**

## Creating a Configuration from a Template

Using templates makes it easier to manage multiple configurations. You can create a configuration from the **Template Details** page. Refer to [Creating a Configuration from a Template](../templates/creating-a-configuration-from-a-template).

## Auto-Generating a Configuration
