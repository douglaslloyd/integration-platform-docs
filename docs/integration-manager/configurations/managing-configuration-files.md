# Managing Configuration Files

**<font color="red">Need to explain the different use cases for configuration files (packages, process files, etc.).</font>**

You can upload files for use with your configurations. These can be public files or private files.

* Private Files can be created, edited, or deleted by the loggedâ€“in user. These files are visible to administrators.
* Public Files can be seen and accessed by any user. They can be created, edited, or deleted only by an administrator.

## Viewing Configuration Files

1. Select the **Configurations** tab.
2. Click the name of the configuration for which you want to view files:
