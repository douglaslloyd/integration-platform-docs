# Managing Configuration Files

**<font color="red">Need to explain the different use cases for configuration files (packages, process files, etc.).</font>**

You can upload files for use with your configurations. These can be public files or private files.

* Private Files can be created, edited, or deleted by the logged–in user. These files are visible to administrators.
* Public Files can be seen and accessed by any user. They can be created, edited, or deleted only by an administrator.

## Viewing Configuration Files

To view files associated with a configuration:

1. Select the **Configurations** tab.
2. Click the name of the configuration for which you want to view files:

4. The **Configuration Files** page is displayed, listing all files and linked files from the File Repository associated with the configuration. Note that linked files will show **FROM PRIVATE FILES** or **FROM PUBLIC FILES**:
