# Configurations Overview

A configuration is a set of properties and parameters that specify when, where, and how an integration will be executed. Configurations contain references to a specific integration, the location in which the integration will be executed, and the frequency at which executions will occur.

The process for creating a configuration depends on whether you are using the on-prem or cloud version of Integration Manager. Refer to the following topics:

* [Creating Configurations - Cloud](./creating-configurations-cloud)
* [Creating Configurations - On-Prem](./creating-configurations-on-prem)
