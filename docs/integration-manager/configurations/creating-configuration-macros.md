# Creating Configuration Macros

Configuration macros can be viewed by any user who has at least read access to the configuration. They can only be created, edited, and deleted by users with write access to the configuration, by the configuration owner, or by account admin users.

## Creating Your First Configuration Macro

To create your first configuration macro:

1. On the **Configurations** page, click the configuration for which you want to create a macro:
   
   ![Select Configuration](/img/Configuration-Select.png)
2. On the **Configuration Details** page, click **Macros**:

   ![Configuration Macros](/img/Configuration-Macros1.png)
3. On the **Configuration Macros** page, click the **Add Macro** button:

   ![Configuration Macros](/img/Configuration-Macro-Add.png)

import PartialContent1 from '../../reuse/_add_macro.mdx';

<PartialContent1 name="add_macro" />

10.  You are returned to the **Configuration Macros** page, which lists the new macro:

     ![Configuration Macro Added](/img/Configuration-Macro-Added.png)

## Creating Additional Configuration Macros

Once you have created your first macro, you can add additional rows to the Configurations Macros list and edit the values directly in the list:

import PartialContent2 from '../../reuse/_create_additional_macros.mdx';

<PartialContent2 name="create_additional_macros" />
