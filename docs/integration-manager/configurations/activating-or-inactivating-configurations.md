# Activating or Inactivating Configurations

In order to run a configuration, its status must be Active. Setting the configuration status to Inactive allows you to disable the configuration without deleting it. You can reactivate it later when needed by setting the status back to Active.

You can set the configuration status to Active or Inactive from either the **Configurations** page or the **Configuration Details** page.

## From the Configurations Page

1. Select the **Configurations** tab.
   
   The **Configurations** page displays the available configurations. The **Active** column indicates whether the configuration is currently Active or Inactive. 
2. Click the dropdown arrow next to the **Run** button for the desired configuration.
3. Select **Inactive** to inactivate a currently-active configuration, or select **Active** to reactivate a currently-inactive configuration:

4. The **Active** column is updated to show the current active status:

2. Click the configuration that you want to edit.
3. On the **Configuration Details** page, toggle the **Status** to **Active** or **Inactive**:
