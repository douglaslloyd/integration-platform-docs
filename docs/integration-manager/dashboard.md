**<font color="red">What are we calling the elements on the Dashboard? I refer to them as widgets here.</font>**

The Dashboard provides data visualization charts that you can use to monitor the overall status of your integrations, configurations, and agents. 

## Widgets

The following widgets are available on the Dashboard.

For any widget that shows ![the download icon](/img/icons/download-button.png), click the icon to download the chart in SVG or PNG format, or download the data in CSV format (which you can open in Excel).

### Recent Jobs

Recent Jobs provides a table of recently-run jobs, and displays details and status for each job. Click the Start, Name, Type, Status, or Duration column headings to toggle between ascending and descending sort order. **<font color="red">Need image with better data.</font>**

Sync result status can be:

* **Finished**: Job has successfully completed. A log file is available (or soon will be).
* **Running**: Job is currently executing on a worker.
* **Cancelled**: Job was canceled prior to being acquired by a worker (during the Waiting or Queued state). No log file will be produced.
* **Error**: Job encountered an exception during execution. Depending on configuration and artifact design, the job may or may not have completed. A log file is available (or soon will be).
* **Queued**: Job has been queued for execution by the next available worker.
* **Failed**: Job failed or was manually stopped by user command or exception at some point during initialization or execution. A log file may or may not be available.

### AGENT HEALTH

The AGENT HEALTH chart represents the health status of agents a user has installed. In the following figure, the user has one agent installed and its status is Error. Hover over the chart to see the value per day. **<font color="red">Took this from Avalanche docs. Not sure if it's exactly the same on IM (I need data to test).</font>**

Agent status can be:

* **Healthy**: The agent is connected and ready to receive jobs.
* **Warning**: The Agent has not reported its status in over 3 hours and may require attention.
* **Error**: The Agent has not reported its status in over 6 hours.
* **Updating**: The Agent is currently processing an Update Command, such as Update Worker or Update Engine.
* **Offline**: The Agent is offline or the local service is stopped. This status is typically reported just prior to a shutdown.

You can verify whether the agent is running, and also start the agent service, by opening Windows Services.
