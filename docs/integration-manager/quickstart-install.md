2. Right click the downloaded installer file (integration-manager-3.x.x.exe) and select "Run as Administrator".
3. If you have a previous 3.x.x version installed, you will be coerced to uninstall first. Uninstall will shutdown running services and prepare for library updates, it will NOT remove or alter ProgramData (conf files, logs, etc...).
4. Accept the License Agreement.
5. Select the installation path (default: C:/Program Files/Actian/IntegrationManager).
6. Select the shared data path (default: C:/ProgramData/Actian/IntegrationManager).
7. Installation should take less than a minute.

### Configuration/Reconfiguration

2. Note that if you have a previous installation of Integration Manager, none of your existing property values will be changed.&#x20;
3. You can confirm or alter the path to your DataConnect v12 license file using the property ```engine.licensePath``` (default: C:/ProgramData/Actian/IntegrationManager/license/cosmos.slc).
   * If you were previously using Integration Manager v2 and DataConnect v11, you will need to alter this value before executing any integrations. DataConnect v11 and v12 licenses are not interchangeable.
4. You can also run Integration Manager on a different port using the property ```server.port``` (default: 8080).
5. The application.properties file can be used for a variety of configurations to tailor Integration Manager to your requirements and environment. See the Server Administration documentation for a description of available properties.
6. ANY change to the application.properties file will require a restart of the service.
   * Go to Windows → Administrative Tools → Services.
   * Right click on Actian Integration Manager to stop, start, or restart.
