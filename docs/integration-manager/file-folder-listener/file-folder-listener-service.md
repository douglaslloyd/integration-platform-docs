# File Folder Listener Service

The File Folder Listener Service is used to monitor file directories or cloud storage buckets/containers for new files.

When a new file appears that matches your include/exclude criteria, the associated listener submits the file to a Job Configuration in Integration Manager. The file will be available to the specified integration process using the $(LOCAL_JOB_SPEC_DIR) macro at runtime. For example, a file named Accounts.txt will be available as $(LOCAL_JOB_SPEC_DIR)Accounts.txt.

The File Folder Listener Service is included with the installation of Integration Manager. A Windows service is registered with the name Actian File Folder Listener and must be started manually after configuration is complete.

## Preparing the File Folder Listener Service

### Prerequisites

Integration Manager must be installed, configured, and running.

### Basic Configuration

These properties are located in &lt;ProgramDataDirectory>\Actian\FileFolderListener\conf\application.properties.

| Property | Default Value | Description|
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| listener.backup- directory | — | The folder where backups of successfully submitted files are stored |
| listener.error- directory | — | The folder where copies of failed file submissions are stored, for example, Exceeded max file size, Integration Manager Service was not running, and so on |

## Authorizing the File Folder Listener Service

The File Folder Listener uses OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628) to securely connect to the Integration Manager API.

:::caution[Note]

We strongly recommend enabling HTTPS for your Integration Manager server to protect your data across the wire. For more information, see [Enabling HTTPS](../server-administration/security-enabling-https).

:::

To authorize the File Folder Listener Service:

1. Determine your Integration Manager API base URL, for example:
* http://im-server-hostname.company.net:8080/api
* https://im-server-hostname.company.net:443/api

2. Open a browser window.
3. Navigate to the device code retrieval URL:

    ```
    <im-api-base-url>/device/code?client_id=file-folder-listener&host=<file-folder-listener-hostname>
    ```
    For example:

    ```
    http://im-server-hostname.company.net:8080/api/device/code?client_id=file-folder-listener&host=file-folder-listener-hostname.company.net

    ```
    ```
    https://im-server-hostname.company.net:443/api/device/code?client_id=file-folder-listener&host=file-folder-listener-hostname.company.net
    ```

    :::note
   
      By default, the *file-folder-listener-hostname* and *im-server-hostname* are installed on the same machine, but they don't have to be.

    :::

4. When prompted, enter your Integration Manager User authentication credentials.
   
   Response should look like:
   ```
    {
    approved: false, user_code: "ZEPQ-VOK8",
    hostname: "file-folder-listener-hostname.company.net", device_code: "d4e4b7e7-9172-4562-bf11-98989245c6d7",
    verification_uri_complete: "http://im-server-hostname.company.net:8080/api/device/  activate?user_code=ZEPQ- VOK8",
    client_id: "file-folder-listener", expires_in: 599,
    interval: 15, owner: {
        id: "21368",
        name: "your-username@company.net"
       }
    }
   ```
5. Since you are already authenticated, simply click the device approval URL for “verification_uri_complete.”
   
   Response should look like:
   ```
    # Integration Manager Connection Info
    im.base-url=http://im-server-hostname.company.net:8080
    im.client-id=file-folder-listener
    im.client-secret=afa40ec4-26z1-493e-be71-6a9661d8e474
    im.device-code=d4e4b7e7-9172-4562-bf11-98989245c6d7
    im.user-code=ZEPQ-VOK8
   ```

6. In the &lt;ProgramDataDirectory>\Actian\FileFolderListener\conf\application.properties file, delete any duplicate entries and then copy and paste the response into the file.
   
## Platform Listener Configurations

Follow the appropriate link for the Listener you want to configure:

* [Local Folder Listener](./local-folder-listener)
* [AWS S3 Bucket Listener](./aws-s3-bucket-listener)
* [Azure Blob Storage Listener](./azure-blob-storage-listener)
* [Google Cloud Storage Listener](./google-cloud-storage-listener)

## Advanced Configuration Properties

You can add these properties to &lt;ProgramDataDirectory>\Actian\FileFolderListener\conf\application.properties to further customize behavior.

| Property | Default&nbsp;Value | Description|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| listener.retain-backup-files | true | Set this to false to not retain backup files. Error files will still be saved. |
| listener.backup-directory-max-file-age | 7 | The number of days backup files are retained |
| listener.error-directory-max-file-age | 14 | The number of days error files are retained |

# File Size Configuration and Limitations

File size limitations are governed by the Integration Manager multipart file configuration in the &lt;ProgramDataDirectory>\Actian\IntegrationManager\conf\application.properties file.

For example, to support 100 MB file size:


```
# MultipartFiles
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=100KB
spring.servlet.multipart.location=${sharedDataPath}/tmp
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=100MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=100MB
```
For unlimited file size (not recommended, as results are subject to hardware or OS limitations, which could lead to unrecoverable data loss):

```
# MultipartFiles
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=100KB
spring.servlet.multipart.location=${sharedDataPath}/tmp
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=-1
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=-1
```
